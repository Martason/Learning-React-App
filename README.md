 When I started this project, I was determined not to spend much time on it. Mainly because of my little baby of 6 weeks but also because I prejudicedly didn't think that react would be "my thing". How wrong I was! I've had a blast and wish I could have spent more time testing and playing around. My app is more or less self-explanatory: It's a web app where I show what I've learned so far. Was inspired by my friend Pia.

I shouldn't take too much credit for the Todo app because it is from a tutorial that I followed. But the pokemon page was quite fun and I spent most of the time here and actually redesigned the component to bring in an autocomplete component from MUI. Jointed perfectly ok but I couldn't get the styling to work on a dark background which was very frustrating. Didn't have time to get into it, but to make the background brighter instead.
