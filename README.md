 When I started this project, I was determined not to spend much time on it. Mainly because of my little baby of 6 weeks but also because I prejudicedly didn't think that react would be "my thing". How wrong I was! I've had a blast and wish I could have spent more time testing and playing around. My app is more or less self-explanatory: It's a web app where I show what I've learned so far. Was inspired by my friend Pia.

I shouldn't take too much credit for the Todo app because it is from a tutorial that I followed. But I leard alot and made a few inprovements. ![Todo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89383163/189978398-b3ba1406-6062-4742-a4ab-5186a370e086.jpg)

The pokemon page was so much fun and I spent most of the time on this page. I actually redesigned the component totaly to bring in an autocomplete funktion from MUI. Its not perfect cuz I didnt have time to fix the styling to work on a dark background which was very frustrating. So I made a quickfix to make the background brighter on that component instead.
