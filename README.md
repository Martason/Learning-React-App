"When I started this project, my initial plan was not to spend much time on it due to my five-week-old baby at home. Additionally, I had a preconceived notion that React wouldn't be my forte. However, I soon realized how wrong I was. I thoroughly enjoyed learning React.js, and I wish I had more time to experiment, test, and refactor. My web application is self-explanatory; it showcases what I have learned so far in React.js."

I shouldn't take too much credit for the Todo app because it is from a tutorial that I followed. But I leard alot and made a few inprovements to the original code. ![Todo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89383163/189978398-b3ba1406-6062-4742-a4ab-5186a370e086.jpg)

"I had so much fun working on the Pokemon page and spent most of my time on it. I even redesigned the component to include an autocomplete function from MUI, but it's still far from perfect and not finished. Unfortunately, I had difficulty fixing the styling to work on a dark background, which was frustrating, so I ended up with a quick fix by making the background brighter instead. The error handling on the fetch needs to be updated, as it's currently a bit of a mess since I rewrote everything."
