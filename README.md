When I started this project, My plan was to not to spend much time on it. Mainly because of my little baby at home of 5 weeks, but also because I prejudicedly didn't think that react would be "my thing". How wrong I was! I've had a blast trying it out and I wish I could have spent more time testing, playing around and refactoring. My app is more or less self-explanatory: It's a web app where I show what I've learned so far.

I shouldn't take too much credit for the Todo app because it is from a tutorial that I followed. But I leard alot and made a few inprovements. ![Todo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89383163/189978398-b3ba1406-6062-4742-a4ab-5186a370e086.jpg)

The pokemon page was so much fun and I spent most of the time on this page. I actually redesigned the component totaly to bring in an autocomplete funktion from MUI. Its far from perfect, perfahps not even finnished. Partley beacuz I spent too much time to fix the styling to work on a dark background and just couldnt get it right, which was very frustrating. So I ended up with a quickfix to make the background brighter on that component instead. I also want to refactor the MUI component to be its own component in my code. And the error handeling on the fetch is also a rest from how the component worked before.
