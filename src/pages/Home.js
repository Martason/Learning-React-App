          <p>
            My name is MÃ¤rta and on this webbapp I crash and burn to learn
            react. It's quite the mess I know, but hopefully I learn some cool
            trixs to bring to my next, more coherent project
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Please have a look around
          </p>
        </>
      ) : (
        <p></p>
      )}
    </>
  );
